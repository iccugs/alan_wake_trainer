# Alan Wake Trainer

A C++ trainer for Alan Wake on Steam, providing memory manipulation and trainer functionality.

## Credits

This project was built using tutorials and code examples from [GuidedHacking.com](https://guidedhacking.com). All credit for the original memory manipulation, process injection, and core trainer functionality goes to the [GuidedHacking](https://guidedhacking.com) community and their educational resources. This project simply builds upon their foundational work and adapts it for the Castlevania Dominus Collection.

Special thanks to [GuidedHacking.com](https://guidedhacking.com) for their comprehensive game hacking tutorials and code examples.

## Learn to Make Game Hacks

I learned everything I needed to know about pointer scanning and hacking Unity games by using the website [GuidedHacking.com](https://guidedhacking.com).
